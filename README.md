Visual display tool to help keep track of remaining Pokémon, featured in Niantic's Pokémon Go, to catch/evolve.

It also uses localStorage to keep track of your selections.

## Reason

I needed a quicker way to see all the Pokémon I had missing and show other's what was missing so they could say 'Oh, I have spare of that...'

## Give it a try

  - Giratina
- add new display for filter list (too many at the top now)

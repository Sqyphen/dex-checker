# Dex checker

Tool to help keep track of remaining mon's to catch/evolve

## Demo

Checkout a demo using my latest dex results: [https://sqyphen.github.io/dex-checker/index.html](https://sqyphen.github.io/dex-checker/index.html)

## Launch 

- Clone the repo
- Open the index.html file


Update the ```pokemonMissing``` const in script.js to match missing mons from your dex


## Todo

+ hide mons if base evolution is caught already
+ add styles for smaller screens


## Thanks
